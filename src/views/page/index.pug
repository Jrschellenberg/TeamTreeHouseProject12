        h1.text-center Justin's Route Calculator
        p.my-4 This is an application to allow a user to select locations using google maps. The user selects  
          | a location to start from, a location to end at, and multiple locations in between. The application
          | will then calculate the shortest possible trip with the given input. Once the route has been calculated.
          | It will then render the route, broken into instructions. If you wish, you may save your phone number to the account, and then text
          | the instructions to your phone, along with google map routes for each linked destination.
        p#requestVue In order to begin using this application, Please login and authenticate using Googles OAuth V2. This is 
          | to ensure that no malicious api calls may be requested against my server, as I have rate limiting. Users may
          | make up to 100 API requests every 15 minutes. However, May only make 5 requests using third party services, every 5 minutes.
        
        p This project could still have many aspects of it greatly improved. If someone ends up using this and wishes to have it improved, You can always contact me.
          | However, this project was originally built for educational purposes.
